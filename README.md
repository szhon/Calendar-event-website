# Interative Website For Events
Users can log in, create event, join event and view it on Calendar. 

The calendar components are from internet code, including nextMonth(), preMonth(),whatDay(), isLeap().
Showcld() is also from internet, but largely adapted to add the functionality of showing events and choosing dates.
